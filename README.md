rottenTomatoes
==============

a sample app for rotten tomatoes

1. It took about 15 hours to finish this project. Since I was setting up environment on Mac OS X Yosemite, installing cocoapods took a lot of un-expected time
2. Stories done:
  a. User can view a list of movies from Rotten Tomatoes. All images are loaded asynchronously
  b. Movie details are available by tapping screen
  c. User sees loading state while waiting for results to load. (I am using standard spinner and no third party lib)
  d. Network message is loaded when an API sees network issue.
  e. User can pull to refresh the list of movies.
  f. [Optional]Low res images are used until high res images are available.
  g. Could not finish the DVD part in time. will work on it.
  
3. Used cocoapods for AFNetwork APIs.
